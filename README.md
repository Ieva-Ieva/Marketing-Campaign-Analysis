# Analysis of Marketing Campaigns: Session Duration, Performance Metrics, and Other Points of Interest
## Introduction 
Marketing analysis is vital for business success. To effectively reach and engage with the target audience, companies need to understand the performance of marketing campaigns and user behaviour. 

Investigation of user session times and behaviour patterns gives valuable insights on periods when the customers are most active and responsive to our campaigns. It also allows to optimise the company's marketing efforts and ensure that the customers are targeted specifically at the time when they are most likely to respond and engage. 
Marketing campaigns' analysis also helps to allocate company's resources efficiently and make data-driven decisions on enhancement of marketing strategies.
